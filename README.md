## 🧠 Core Philosophy

ThisIsVietnam is **not a travel guide**.  
It is a **culture-first national knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- assist synthesis across eras
- translate Vietnamese nuance accurately
- connect themes, places, and people
- support long-form storytelling

Humans are required to:
- ensure cultural respect
- validate historical truth
- preserve Vietnamese voice
- prevent oversimplification

---

- Story / Essay
- Artifact / Tradition
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links culturally and historically
- is programmatically generatable
